# Danielle Sternthal Challenge-1

## CSS Edits

Combined classes that has the exact same styling by separating class names with a comma.  I then commented out the separate classes in order to simplify code.  Please see screen shot below for an example:

<img width="501" alt="CondensedCSS" src="https://github.com/dsternthal/Challenge-1/assets/135449777/13cbc112-6490-4ac1-99af-92f09b5fdd10">

I also added all of the classes underneath the sections, so that they were ranked in hierarchical order, as we learned in class.

### Editing HTML 

changes non-sementic code to be semantic.  I used header, section, main, article, figure & footer in order to make my HTML have semantic code. 

Additionally, I added alternative text to all images so that it would be accessible.
